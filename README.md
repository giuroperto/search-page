## Products' Search Page

This is a simple page that aims to help people taking orders (delivery/takeaway) to easily find the current prices.
As it is integrated with an already existing DB, in order to update this app I have an excel file that will convert the fields to the ones I need and in the same format as the json presented here, then I do convert the CSV output to JSON and do all the adjustments needed.

Also, it is deployed in the same provider as the restaurant's website which does not support MONGODB, so I had to develop it all as a front-end only.
